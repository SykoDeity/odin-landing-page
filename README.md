# odin-landing-page
PROJECT | Landing Page (HTML/CSS)

Building and creating an entire web page from a given design.
Since the last project(odin-recipes), I have learnt about some CSS basics such as:
Chrome DevTools, The Box Model, and Flexbox.
This project is designed to put together all of the skill aquired up until now into practice.
The website I'm creating has a header,  4 main sections, and a footer.
